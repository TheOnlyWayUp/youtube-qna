# Youtube QnA

---

Chat with Youtube Channels.

![Showcase](Showcase_Image.png)

Youtube QnA allows you to add Sources, which are Videos, Channels or Playlists. You can then ask a question, selecting one or more sources to refer from. The videos that are most relevant to the question are embedded in the response, along with a timestamp.

By default, OpenAI's API is used to generate answers, this requires you to have an OpenAI API Key. If you want to use your own LLM, refer to [README#Bring your own LLM](README.md#Bring your own LLM).
